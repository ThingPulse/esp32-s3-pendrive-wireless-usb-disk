## Accessing Files Over the Web Interface

When the device is plugged in it will mount a mass storage device with
about 120MB of space. At the same time it starts a WiFi Access Point
`wireless-usb-disk` with password `12345678`. By connecting to this access
point the files on the memory stick can be accessed in the browser: http://192.168.4.1
